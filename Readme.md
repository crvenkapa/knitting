--------------------------------------------

Steps to download the data:

a config.py file as user_name and passwrd
* Create a data and html folder 
* Run `python scraping.py`

The actual data analysis is done in the ipython notebook. To open it you 
need to run `ipython notebook` in the project directory. Or, for easy 
viewing of the notebook, you can go to [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/crvenkapa/knitting/master/ravelry%20project.ipynb).
